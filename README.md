Challenge:  For a future project I need to programmatically determine the vehicles speed.  The Jeep knows it...so let's figure out how to extract it.

Project Goal: Interface with the 2011 Jeep Wrangler CAN message bus, identify the message indicating vehicle speed, and pull the data.

Hardware: Wiring connectors, Arduino Uno, SparkFun CAN shield, 16x2 cheap LCD display, DB9 serial bus cable, Nerves of Steel.
